**A  Prompts for Sentence Generation**

The sentence generation schema consists of three main modules: the task definition, the example sentence, and the format instruction. The task definition provides a natural language representation of the rules from the Rule2NL part. The example sentence helps the generative model understand the rule's meaning and illustrates the format for the third part. The format instruction guides the model to generate sentences in the correct structure. For example, the mMiN rule, ♢¬p ⊢ ¬□p, translates to “If ‘probably not p’ is true, then we can infer ‘not necessarily p’.” .

**B  Task MCQA(Question selection and incorrect generation)**

Candidate questions for the MCQA task are randomly selected from the following three questions.

1.	What would be the most appropriate conclusion based on the given context?
	
2.	In light of the provided context, what conclusion can be considered the most ap-propriate?

3.	Based on the context, what conclusion would be deemed most suitable?

The generated prompt regarding the MCQA incorrect option is shown in Fig. 4

**C  Prompt for Task BQA and MCQA Evaluation**

For BQA and MCQA tasks, the zero-shot CoT format differs between the two. BQA involves determining whether a question is true or false, so the input requires only the context, question, and CoT prompt. In contrast, for MCQA, you also need to provide options. We have defined three different prompt strategies for each task.

**D  The Example of Process Fallacies**

GPT4omini  | 1. The context establishes that if Noah trains for the marathon, he must build physical endurance.2. It is also established that if Mia prepares healthy meals, she must feel energized.3. We know that either Noah necessarily trains for the marathon, or Mia necessarily does not feel energized.4. If Noah does not train for the marathon, then Mia must not feel ener-gized, which implies Mia does not prepare healthy meals.5. Therefore, it is always true that at least one of the following must hold:- (a) Noah builds physical endurance (if he trains for the mara-thon).- (b) Mia does not prepare healthy meals (if she does not feel en-ergized).
qwq-32b-preview  | 1. Let's break down the given statements and see what they imply.2. First, "if it is necessarily the case that Noah trains for the marathon, then he must necessarily build physical endurance." this can be repre-sented as: □n → □e, where n is "Noah trains for the marathon" and e is "Noah builds physical endurance."3. Second, "if it is necessarily the case that Mia prepares healthy meals, then she must necessarily feel energized." this can be represented as: □m → □f, where m is "Mia prepares healthy meals" and f is "Mia feels en-ergized."4. Third, "it is understood that either Noah necessarily trains for the marathon or Mia necessarily does not feel energized." this can be repre-sented as: □n ∨ □¬f.5. We need to determine if at least one of the following is always true: (a) it must be the case that Noah builds physical endurance (□e), or (b) it must not be the case that Mia prepares healthy meals (□¬m).6. So, we need to see if □e ∨ □¬m is always true given the previous statements.7. Let's consider the possible scenarios. 8. Scenario 1: □n is true. a. from □n → □e, if □n is true, then □e must be true. b. therefore, in this scenario, □e is true, so □e ∨ □¬m is true.9. Scenario 2: □n is false. a. from □n ∨ □¬f, if □n is false, then □¬f must be true. b. so, □¬f is true, which means it is necessarily the case that Mia does not feel energized. c. now, consider □m → □f. d. if □m is true, then □f must be true. e. but we have □¬f is true, which contradicts □f.f. therefore, □m cannot be true;  otherwise, we have □f and □¬f, which is a contradiction. g. hence, □¬m must be true. h. therefore, in this scenario, □¬m is true, so □e ∨ □¬m is true.10. In both possible scenarios, □e ∨ □¬m is true.11. Therefore, we can say that at least one of (a) or (b) is always true.
DeepSeek-R1(the thought process is removed) | 1. Premises: N → B, M → E, and N ∨ ¬E.2. If N is true, B must hold (from N→B), making (a) true.3. If N is false, ¬E must hold (from N∨¬E).4. ¬E implies ¬M (contrapositive of M→E), making (b) true.5. Thus, in all scenarios, at least (a) or (b) is necessarily true.
